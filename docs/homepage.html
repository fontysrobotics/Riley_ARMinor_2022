                    <p class="w3-text-black w3-large">At the Mechatronics and Robotics Lab (Lectoraat) we are helping industry partners and the research community to overcome several 
                      robotics challenges, for that we participate in different founded projects at national or European level. The RiLey is such a project that is funded by
                      the Taskforce for Applied Research SIA, or Regieorgaan SIA for short.<br/> 
                      In this project, we want to investigate whether we can adapt a low-cost robot, which is intended to be controlled remotely, to perform autonomous multi 
                      robot environmental inspection. A small and cheap robot is extremely suitable for this application, could be used anywhere and can easily be taken with you.
                      With affordable robots, it would also be possible with multiple robots to scan a large location faster.<br/>
                      The partnership for this project consists of several parties: a company that wants to put its product on the market (SITA Robotics), two technology partners
                      (TMC and Avular) and Fontys as a research partner to come up with innovative solutions.

                    <h3 class="w3-padding-32">RILey's use case</h3>
                    <p class="w3-text-black w3-large">The RILey robot is used as an autonomous reconnaissance platform for scanning (un)known locations suchs as buildings. 
                      This scanning task is performed by combining sensory data, and sending this to a remote server where this data can be processed and interpreted. 
                    </p>
      
                    <h3 class="w3-padding-32">RILey's Problem</h3>
                    <p class="w3-text-black w3-large">One of the challenges is that the existing low-cost robot does not have the processing ability to perform the necessary 
                      sensor analysis and processing of the associated algorithms on the platform itself. For this we want to read all sensor data from the robot and
                      send it wirelessly to a server, this server will then do all the necessary data processing and send its analyses back to the robot, so that 
                      it can take any actions on this. The speed of data processing plays a major role in this. <br/>
                      An additional challenge will be how the robot can locate itself with a limited set of sensors in an (un)known environment. Where other robot 
                      systems mainly use more advanced sensors to make a scan of the environment, the SITA robot has only a few sensors available, mainly only a 2D
                      video stream supplemented with data from an IMU. This localization will also have to be carried out on a remote system.
                    </p>
      
                    <h3 class="w3-padding-32">RILey's Founders</h3>
                    <p class="w3-text-black w3-large">SITA Robotics is a company that has created the original RILey. The idea came of a simple throw-a-bot, and they wanted
                      to improve it to an usable remote inspection robot.
